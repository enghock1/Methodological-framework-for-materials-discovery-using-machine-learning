# Code used in methodological-framework-for-materials-discovery-using-machine-learning paper.

# The preprocessed data for the first case study (vdW vs nvdW modeling) is located in data\vdW_nvdW\preprocessed_materials_project_data.csv.
# Similarly, the preprocessed data for the second case study (wide bandgap vs non-wide bandgap) is located in data\UV_nUV\preprocessed_vdW_data.csv.

# To repeat the first case study experiment, run the python scripts in scripts\vdW_nvdW_classification.
# To repeat the second case study experiment, run the python scripts in scripts\UV_classification.

# The software used to run the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm in this project 
# is licensed and hence cannot be posted in public. Instead, we suggest several alternative SOM packages 
# that can be used to run SOM modeling (although they are not tested for this project):
